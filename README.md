# Development Setup
We're using [black](https://github.com/psf/black). It helps us keep the code style
aligned throughout the project.

To make sure your code is well formatted, please install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). 
After that just run `pre-commit install` in the repositories root directory.
